        <p class="text">With the abolition of slavery, many people of African descent were left off in the various
            countries that they were taken to. The brutalities of slavery have traumatized these people that have lasted
            to this day. Whether it be the kidnapping from oneâ€™s own home, the torturous conditions one was put under,
            or the overall dehumanizing nature of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade (1526 - 1867), many seek out some kind
            of payment to at least heal those who have and continue to be traumatized by the outcomes of slavery, or in
            other words: reparations.

        <p class="text">Slavery in the world, while all brutal, has some differences between the various countries that
            had abused the systems. In particular, the way they dealt with the aftermath of slavery and how they paid
            reparations is a point of interest that this website will delve into, particularly looking at the United
            States of America, Britain, and the Caribbean.</p>
