    <h1>American Reparations</h1>

        <p class="text"> Slavery in America had technically been outlawed after Lincoln ruled the emancipation
            proclamation
            in 1863, freeing many slaves. However, while this was a huge step for the former enslaved, what resulted was
            far
            from being free. The former enslaved were free but had nothing to go off. Indeed, the reparations that were
            given, or the lack of, to African Americans left many needing to earn money through sharecropping, as that
            was
            the most immediate access to resources they had. Indeed, PBS outlines this, stating that under
            sharecropping,
            there were “high-interest rates, unpredictable harvests, and unscrupulous landlords and merchants often kept
            tenant farm families severely indebted, requiring the debt to be carried over until the next year or the
            next”
            ("Sharecropping").¹ It can then be argued that for many formerly enslaved in America, they
            were
            paid
            with another form of being enslaved, just under “legal” circumstances.</p>
        <p class="text"> This issue of reparations becomes more apparent as society progresses past slavery and evolves
            with
            the underlying issues that slavery had implanted into society, mainly involving racism. The Atlantic
            magazine
            had overviewed one event that involved such an issue as far as the 1920s, decades after slavery ended. In
            it,
            the author, Ta-Nehisi Coates, speaks about Clyde Ross, a black man who grew up on a black, family-owned
            farm.
            Clyde’s father, however, was robbed of his land by authorities and was completely vulnerable as he had
            nothing
            to rely on for protection. This is just one instance that “some 406 victims and 24,000 acres of land valued
            at
            tens of millions of dollars” (Coates) had faced well after slavery.²

            These are the various reasons that people in America have argued for reparations. As a result, many people,
            groups, and organizations have demanded reparations from the American government in order to somewhat
            reprimand
            those who have been affected by these injustices. One such organization is the Universal Association of
            Ethiopian Women, formed by Queen Mother Audley Moore. According to the article “Somebody Has to Pay: Audley
            Moore, Mother of the Reparations Movement” by Ashley Farmer, Queen Mother Audley
            Moore, growing up in the Jim Crow state of Lousiana, had “began a campaign to encourage African Americans to
            file a formal reparations claim with the U.S. government before the end of 1963”. She had demanded,
            “approximately 36 million dollars in back pay to be used for African American emigration to Africa, cultural
            and
            political development in black communities, and past wages for those who wanted to remain in America”
            (Farmer).³
            Through her research, she advocated for the reparations of African Americans who had undergone many
            wrongdoings
            as stated before, and more. It seems that for her, money was the most immediate form of action as a form of
            reparation.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> However, this is certainly not the only form of reparation that people demand. The recent rise
            of
            the Black Lives Matters Movement has also delved into the topic of reparations. These demands talk more
            in-depth
            to speaking about issues such as “an end to the death penalty, legislation to acknowledge the effects of
            slavery, as well as investments in education initiatives, mental health services and jobs programs”
            (Alcindor).⁴ Indeed, the topic of reparations becomes more complex when factoring in the problems that
            resulted
            from slavery, on top of the problems slavery itself caused on its superficial level. Many organizations,
            such as
            NAARC and N’COBRA are specifically seeking out reparations and aiding people to this day.
