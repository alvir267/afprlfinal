        <p class="text">Slavery in Britain had been very much tied to the trade aspect of it. The Trans Atlantic Slave
            Trade had benefitted Britain greatly in profits as they pushed people out of Africa and forced them mostly
            westwards. While America was a large part of it, they had also dealt with the Caribbean. Indeed, the
            Caribbean was a large destination for many slaveholders to engage in the trade as well as a place for many
            to force them into labor. </p>
        <p class="text">Slavery in the Caribbean was just as horrifying as it was in America. One of the main
            differences was the mindset of slaveholders. Often times slaves were seen as replaceable through trade, so
            they were not often taken care of and weren’t forced to make children amongst themselves. They were treated
            with less care as they could simply buy more. They had forced them to work on cash crop fields to create
            massive profits for the slaveholders, many times all the way back in Britain. Indeed, the slaveholders had
            lived away from their plantations and were less involved with their slaves. These differences paint a
            different picture than compared to American slavery and with it comes its own consequences of the state of
            slaves and their conditions after slavery had been abolished, shaping demands for reparations in a different
            way.</p>

        <p class="text">Indeed, one of the most significant points of debate for British/Caribbean reparations is the
            immediate results of the abolition of slavery in 1834. The Slave Compensation Act 1837 was essentially
            paying back former slaveholders. It can be seen in the document <em>Accounts of slave
                compensation claims</em>, that in fact former British slaveholders in many
            British
            territories, were compensated for their slaves when slavery was abolished.¹ They were paid with money by the
            British government for the “property” they had lost. This is further emphasized by the fact that the former
            enslaved themselves were not given any compensation. In fact, many of the former enslaved of British
            slaveholders had undergone apprenticeships after they had gained their freedom. Much like the sharecropping
            abuse in America, former slaves “worked as before for their former owner, for three-quarters of their time,
            and could work for others for the rest of the week and receive a small wage. This period was supposed to get
            the ex-slaves prepared for their freedom in eight years' time at the end of the apprenticeship” (Discovering
            Bristol). This system of apprenticeship was seen as another form of slavery even after its former abolition,
            to the point that this system was abolished in 1838.</p>
        <p class="text">Many similarities to America can be drawn from this whilst also spotting differences.
            Regardless, the idea for demanding reparations remain–the generations of the former enslaved want
            compensation for the outcomes that slavery has instilled into society. <em> Britain's Black Debt:
                Reparations for
                Caribbean Slavery and Native Genocide </em> by Hilary McD. Beckles gives a general example of this,
            stating
            “Caribbean indigenous communities, still caught in the grip of British genocidal policies, and blacks who
            have remained deeply economically disenfranchised and racially targeted as a subordinate ethnicity by racist
            ideology, suffered considerable harm within the slavery and post-slavery systems maintained by Britain”.²
            Beckles suggests that in the Caribbean, one of slavery’s effects was the racist philosophies placed upon
            society that had further wronged Black people within the Caribbean. These reparations then, are to undo
            these philosophies as well. The idea of “subordinate ethnicity” plagues societies to this day and is what is
            demanded.</p>
        <p class="text">These wrongdoings that Beckles outlines can be seen within the goals of organizations such as
            The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) which formed to seek these reparations. CARICOM’s 10-point plan is very
            similar to the demands that American organizations look for. Within their demands, they particularly lean on
            education and its importance of it. Whether it be to create “African Knowledge Programs” or “Cultural
            Institutions” they aim to have everyone, former slave families, former slaveholder families, and those who
            were not directly involved, to be educated on the subject as well as educated on what it means to be
            African.³</p>
